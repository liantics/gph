#Green Planet Heroes

This is a fundraising web site for renewable energy and energy efficiency
projects. The goal of the site is to provide a fundraising platform for people
who want to either save energy, or switch to renewable energy sources.

Such projects do receive some funding on other platforms, but they tend to get
lost in the "ooh shiny!" of new tech, arts projects, etc. that other platforms
are designed to attract. The goal of Green Planet Heroes is to connect people
who want to do something about energy and CO2, with those who want to help them.
